# Data Science & Python Projects

A collection of personal projects and learning exercises as I develop my data science and programming skills.

## Chess Project - Turing College
This was the first graded project I did at Turing College. 
It’s a Python script that lets the user set up a chess board with one white piece and several black pieces, then figures out which black pieces the white one can capture.

## Calculator Project - Turing College
A small class-based Python calculator that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and taking roots. 
It also keeps a running memory value that can be reset. 
Includes basic tests and documentation.

## Spotify Kaggle Dataset Project - Turing College
An EDA of Spotify’s Top 50 Tracks 2020 dataset. 
The goal was to answer a long list of business-style questions, using Pandas to find patterns in track features. 
This project was my first taste of putting multiple analysis steps together into a single workflow.

## Coursera Kaggle Dataset Project - Turing College
A more open-ended analysis of a Coursera course dataset. 
The task here was to figure out what kinds of questions are worth exploring and then use data analysis and visualization to answer them. 
It was a nice way to practice raising hypotheses, checking assumptions, and presenting results visually.

## BB-RSI Trading Strategy Script - Personal project
A personal project exploring a simple mean-reversion trading idea on BTC/EUR using RSI and Bollinger Bands.
I used Python with Pandas, pandas_ta, Backtrader, and CCXT to fetch Kraken data, calculate signals, and back-test a basic strategy with entry/exit rules.
Also includes plots to visualize price, bands, RSI levels, and trade markers.
This was mainly a way for me to practice structuring a small trading script.

## eSveikata Slot Checker - Personal project
An automation script I wrote to help my cousin, who has autism, get into government-funded rehabilitation. 
Slots are extremely limited and disappear quickly when they open. 
This script was scrapping 24/7 the eSveikata portal for two months’ worth of appointment data to check for newly available slots and sent me notifications the moment one appeared, so I could register immediately. 
It was a personal project aimed at solving a real problem for my family.
